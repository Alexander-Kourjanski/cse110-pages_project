## Introduction
![](/image_for_webpage/image-of-self.PNG)

Hello, I am Alexander Kourjanski. Currently, I am a third year student at UC San Diego majoring in computer science. The story of how I chose to major in this field is somewhat of an *interesting* story. Until I reached college, I disliked the idea of programming funny enough. I could understand the very basics of the basics like `print("Hello world!")`, but anything past this and simple arithmetic would never make sense to me no matter how much I tried. If you would have talked to me even just two years ago and ask me what I want to major in just before starting college, my answer would be,
>Anything but computer science.

I started college as an undeclared major since I did not know what I wanted to do. For my first year, I took a wide variety of classes to see if any would inspire me. Spring quarter of my first, I took the class CSE 8a for a GE requirement. Something just clicked and I ended up enjoying doing all the PAs and extra credit assignments. At the end of the quarter I declared my major as math and computer science. When I completed the prerequisite classes for the computer science major, I switched my major to computer science in the spring of my second year, and never regretted my choice. 
## Experience

After starting programming at UCSD, I have gained a lot of knowledge and experience. Right now, the languages that I am the most comfortable with are

1. Python
2. C++
3. Java
4. C

The language that I am using the most is python at the moment since I am currently working on a project using this language. The project is a library that uses the Google Maps API to extract Google Street-View images of entire roadsystems at a time. There are 6 types of methods that are in this library, graph generaters, graph truncaters, road geometry, intersections, road interpolation, and image request. This project is still a work in progress, and the types of methods that I have finalized at the moment are

- [x] graph generaters
- [x] graph truncaters
- [ ] road geometry
- [ ] intersections
- [ ] road interpolation
- [ ] image request

## Hobbies

Outside of classes, one of my hobbies is to sing in a cappella. I am the treasurtary of the group [Duly Noted](image_for_webpage/duly-noted-photo.PNG) which is one of the nine a cappella groups at UCSD. You can find the Instagram page [here](https://www.instagram.com/ucsddulynoted/?hl=en). Some songs that we sing are
  
- September - Earth, Wind and Fire
- Dear Future Husband - Meghan Trainer
- No One - Alicia Keys
- and so much more
